; First you must have java, best if it's 1.8.


; Clojure install? Actually best way is to start with Leiningen installed
; directly, not with a package manager, which is typically out of date.
; Follow instructions on http://leiningen.org/


; after successful install you should be able to do this on the terminal
; lein version
; => Leiningen 2.5.3 on Java 1.8.0_11 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM


; Setting up an editor? For actual work you will want an editor
; with an integrated REPL. It's extremely painful to attempt to
; use clojure as you would ruby or java.
