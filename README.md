## 1. Make sure java is installed
First you must have java, best if it's 1.8.

After installation you should be get this on your terminal
```sh
java -version

=> java version "1.8.0_11"
```


## 2. Install Leiningen
Clojure install? Actually much simpler to start with Leiningen, which
should be installed directly, not with a package manager, as they are
typically out of date.

Follow instructions on http://leiningen.org/

After installation you should be get this on your terminal
```sh
lein version

=> Leiningen 2.5.3 on Java 1.8.0_11 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```



## 3. Setup an Editor with integrated REPL
Setting up an editor? For actual work you will want an editor
with an integrated REPL. It's extremely painful to attempt to
use clojure as you would ruby or java.

LighTable is absolutely great. http://lighttable.com/
